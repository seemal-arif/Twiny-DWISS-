## Description
This project was developed for a **Shopify-based** watch store to introduce a Web3 ownership feature. When customers purchase a watch from the Shopify store, they receive an email notifying them that they can also claim digital ownership of the watch on the blockchain. To do so, they need to install the DWISS mobile app, where they can mint their watch as an NFT. The platform also allows users to update their watch attributes and engage with a dedicated community.Additionally, this project includes a mobile app (DWISS) and an admin panel for managing users and watches.

## Technical Aspects:
- **Backend & CRM**: Developed the backend and CRM for the DWISS mobile app and admin panel.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Utilized Node.js for backend services and Express.js for API development.
- **Firebase Integration**: Integrated Firebase for push notifications.
- **Shopify Webhooks**: Implemented Shopify webhooks to track store transactions and trigger ownership emails.
- **Smart Contracts on Polygon**: Deployed smart contracts on Polygon Amoy (testnet) and Polygon mainnet for live operations.
  
## Role:
